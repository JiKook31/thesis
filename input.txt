TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem
 of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers
  easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team within
Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep
neural networks research. The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains,
as well.
TensorFlow provides stable Python and C++ APIs, as well as non-guaranteed backwards compatible API for other
languages.

See the TensorFlow install guide for the pip package, to enable GPU support, use a Docker container,
and build from source.
To install the current release for CPU-only:
$ pip install tensorflow
Use the GPU package for CUDA-enabled GPU cards:
$ pip install tensorflow-gpu
Nightly binaries are available for testing using the tf-nightly and tf-nightly-gpu packages on PyPi.

It provides:

    a powerful N-dimensional array object
    sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
    tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
    useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Testing:

    NumPy versions â‰¥ 1.15 require pytest
    NumPy versions < 1.15 require nose

Tests can then be run after installation with:

python -c 'import numpy; numpy.test()'
